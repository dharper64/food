# Set up the project to use Firebase
1.	Install the CLI by running the following npm command: npm -g install firebase-tools
2.	Verify that the CLI has been installed correctly by running the following command: firebase --version
3.	Authorize the Firebase CLI by running the following command: firebase login
    (Make sure your project has a database set up before proceding)
4.	Make sure that your command line is accessing your app's local 'top level' directory.
5.	Associate your app with your Firebase project by running the following command: firebase use --add
6.	When prompted, select your Project ID, then give your Firebase project an alias. An alias is useful if you have multiple environments (production, staging, etc).

3.	Using your browser, open your app at http://localhost:5000.
